Diving has always been one of the sports that I enjoyed watching during olympics since young.

Seeing our national driver Nur Dhabitah Sabri making it to the TOP 5 during the recent Tokyo Olympics 2020, I was inspired to explore how pose estimation for driving can be made possible through Phyton using opencv machine learning package.

In this pose estimation project, I am using diving videos from the past olympics of Nur Dabitah Sabri in creating a prototype of score prediction which I hope to achieve.
