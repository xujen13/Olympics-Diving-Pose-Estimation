Diving has always been one of the sports that I enjoyed watching during olympics since I was young. 

With Nur Dhabitah Sabri making it to Top 5 during the recent Tokyo Olympics 2020, I would like to explore how pose estimation can be made possible with Python using opencv machine learning package. 

In this pose estimation project, I used diving olympics videos of Nur Dhabitah Sabri to create a protoype and hopefully score prediction can be achieved sometime in the future.
